This is **Md. Rashed**,I received my B.Sc. in Information and Communication Engineering ([ICE](https://www.pust.ac.bd/academic/departments/dept_teachers/D06/)) from Pabna University of Science and Technology([PUST](https://www.pust.ac.bd/)). I have always been interested in academic, co-curricular and
research activities. I have finished some government funded researches and innovation
projects. I have published a research paper in peer-reviewed international journal.Beside those, I also conduct research with [BioRAIN Lab](https://biorainlab.net/). 

My research interests are:
