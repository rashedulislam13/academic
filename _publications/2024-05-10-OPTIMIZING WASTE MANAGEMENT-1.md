excerpt: 'Traditional waste management is labor-intensive and inefficient, while efficient systems are crucial for sustainable cities. This study proposes an IoT-based smart waste management system to improve trash disposal and monitoring in urban areas. The suggested solution uses smart trash cans equipped with ultrasonic sensors, ARDUINO UNO, servo motors, and GSM communication to monitor waste levels and notify relevant personnel. The system automates waste collection, enhancing scalability and adaptability. The project aims to make the technology affordable, promoting environmental sustainability and green practices.'
