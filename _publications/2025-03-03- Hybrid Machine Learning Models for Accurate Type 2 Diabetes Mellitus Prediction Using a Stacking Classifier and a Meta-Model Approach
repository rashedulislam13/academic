excerpt: '
This study addresses Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), a vital aspect of human-computer interaction, using a hybrid model combining CNN, LSTM, and KNN algorithms. The CNN extracts acoustic features from speech spectrograms, while LSTM captures temporal dependencies. KNN classifies emotional states based on these features. The model, tested on the TESS dataset, achieves high accuracy and robustness, outperforming traditional methods. It holds promise for real-world applications in sentiment analysis, virtual assistants, and more, advancing SER techniques for improved human-computer interaction.'
