title: "Hybrid Machine Learning Models for Accurate Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Prediction Using a Stacking Classifier and a Meta-Model Approach"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Diabetes Prediction
excerpt: 'This paper presents a hybrid machine learning approach for accurate Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prediction, integrating a stacking classifier with a meta-model to enhance predictive performance. By leveraging multiple machine learning techniques, the study aims to improve early diagnosis and assist healthcare professionals in data-driven decision-making.
